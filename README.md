# odin-recipes
this is a introduction to what i have learned over this course html
On this journey with the project at hand ive learned how to img src and making unordered list /ordered lists thats present in the recipes page 
I have learned many thing from odin project so far im glad i have stumbled across this site but doing the first project on odins project has made me fall in love with what im doing.
so far ive learned how to make a boilerplate and how to navigate linux and git 
i will without a doubt get better at sending my git commits and and how to make a proper README
